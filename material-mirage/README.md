## Dependencies ##
I have made my best effort to reduce the number of dependencies by using the awesome API to its fullest extent, and allowing users to edit the `apps.lua` file (see [installation section](#installation)) to define their own preferred applications. That being said, here are the dependencies.

|Dependency|Description|
|:----------:|:-------------:|
|`awesome-git`|Window manager - **must use git version.** If you are using an Arch based distro you can install it off of the AUR. Otherwise [refer to the installation instructions](https://github.com/awesomeWM/awesome/)|
|`feh`|Fast image viewer used as wallpaper setting utility|
|`compton-tryone`|Window compositor, eliminates screen tearing and allows for cool fade & blur effects|
|`rofi-git`|Application launcher - **must use git version**|
|`imagemagick`|Used in config to generate blurred wallpaper|

### Optional Dependencies ###
These will improve the user experience but aren't required:
**Bear in mind that most of these dependencies come preinstalled on non arch systems. I would recommend reading their descriptions below to determine which ones you need to install. Alternatively, set up my config and install the packages based on what isn't appearing in the top panel.**
+ `acpi`: Battery managing cli application, used by top bar widget to determine battery status
+ `xfce4-power-manager`: Lightweight power manager spawned when the top panel battery icon is clicked
+ `bluez`, `bluez-utils`: Bluetooth cli application, used by top bar widget to determine if bluetooth is on
+ `blueman`: Bluetooth managing application, spawns when the bluetooth top panel icon is clicked
+ `pamac-aur`: Lightweight GUI package manager, spawned when the top panel package icon is clicked
+ `nm-connection-editor`: GUI wifi connection editor, spawned when the top panel wifi icon is clicked
+ `Scrot`: Screenshot tool, which is mapped to the Print Screen key in keys.lua. **If you want to meet this dependency, ensure that the `~/Pictures` folder exists**, otherwise the program will not save your screenshots
+ `Alsa`: Provides kernel driven sound drivers, which the control of has been mapped to volume keys in keys.lua
+ `xbacklight`: Controls display brightness, which the control of has been mapped to brightness keys in keys.lua

### Fonts You Should Install ###
+ `SF Text`: System font used by macOS, iOS, and watchOS. Used in this config as the WM font. Also used as font for firefox
+ `Fira Code`: Great monospaced font with ligature support, used in terminal and text editors

<a name="installation"></a>
## Installation ##
1. Ensure all [dependencies](#dependencies) are met
2. Clone this repository and place its contents into your `.config` folder
3. navigate to the `awesome` folder and place your desired wallpaper there, ensuring that it is named `wallpaper`. One  awesome (pun intended) feature of my config is that the filetype of the wallpaper can be any image filetype and it will automatically recognize it. Remember to delete the `blurredWallpaper` file in order to make the blurring script recognize a new wallpaper has been added and needs to be blurred 
4. edit the `apps.lua` file to define your desired default and startup applications. If you do not have an application installed that matches a given variable name, change the variable to `''` (ie: if you do not have an image editor installed, ensure `apps.imageEditor = ''`)
5. If the wifi top bar widget is not working, edit the `widgets/wifi.lua` file and ensure that the `local interface` variable matches your wifi interface name (if you are unsure how to find your interface name, check out [this discussion](https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=166171)).
6. optional: edit the `keys.lua` file to change / add keybinds

<a name="folderStructure"></a>
## Awesome Folder File Structure ##
In order to avoid a poorly organized `rc.lua` spanning thousands of lines, it has been split into multiple files / folders. I have taken extra care to create a logical directory structure that will hopefully allow those new to awesomewm to have an easy time navigating it.
+ `rc.lua`: Contains the script that runs when awesome starts (essentially links all the other files together)
+ `apps.lua`: Contains the default and startup applications
+ `keys.lua`: Contains keybinds
+ `rules.lua`: Contains window rules
+ `theme.lua`: Contains theme variables
+ `tags.lua`: Contains tag (aka workspace) information, edit this to change the tag's icon and behaviour
+ `icons`: stores icons used in WM
+ `components`: Folder that contains all of the components of the WM, such as panels, volume and brightness sliders, notification pop-ups, etc
+ `widgets`: stores widgets used in the functionality of the components

<a name="applications"></a>
## My Preferred Applications ##
+ **Display Manager - SDDM (with sddm-sugar-candy theme)**: Beautiful display manager. Matches the window manager theme very well and looks amazing
+ **Text Editor - nvim**: I'm an alpha chad
+ **File Manager - Nautilus**: Lightweight file browser, few dependencies, and can be configured to work with a preferred terminal. Also has extensions for easy right click extraction / compression of archive files (ie zip / rar etc)
+ **Web Browser - Firefox**: Super configurable and isn't made by Google
+ **Terminal - Kitty**: Used to use alacritty, switched to kitty as it is very fast and has great ligature implementation (which helps with programming in vim). Is very configurable and has built in tmux-like functionality
+ **Theme / Look & Feel Manager - lxappearance**: makes managing icon / cursor / application themes easy, only theme manager with no DE dependencies, and works very well

### Other cool applications you should install ###
+ `redshift`: Changed screen warmth based on the time of day
+ `neofetch`: Displays system information in the terminal
+ `cmatrix`: Terminal base matrix text effect
+ `cava`: Terminal audio visualizer!

### Zsh ###
**[Guide](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/jazz-up-your-zsh-terminal-in-seven-steps-a-visual-guide-e81a8fd59a38/) if you are having trouble following the steps below**
1. Install a font that supports powerline, my favourites are Fira Code and Source Code Pro, however a quick google search will show many other great fonts
2. Install oh-my-zsh
```
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
```
3. Change the zsh theme to agnoster

4. Fini! Reopen the terminal to view the fruit of your labor

<a name="keybinds"></a>
## Keybinds ##
**Note that the modkey is set to be the windows / command key. If you would like to use a different modkey check out the `keys.lua` file.**
If you are new to awesomewm, note that tag refers to workspace, and client refers to window.

## Notes ##
+ **If the config isn't working there is a 99% chance it's because you are using `awesome` and not `awesome-git`.** Arch and Manjaro users can download the awesome-git package from the AUR, while users on other distros will need to build it from source. This sounds scary but is as simple as folling the steps outlined in [the official awesomeWM repo](https://github.com/awesomeWM/awesome/)
+ [Awesome API Documentation](https://awesomewm.org/apidoc/index.html)
+ If you encounter any problems please open an issue in this repo and I will gladly investigate it
+ If you would like to change the wallpaper, ensure that the wallpaper is named "wallpaper" and is located in the `~/.config/awesome` folder. Also ensure that you delete the blurred wallpaper file in order for the blurring script to recognize it needs to generate a new blurred wallpaper

## TO DO ##
+ rofi placement
+ iconography
+ better way to generate dock members (make file called dock_app, with arguments matching desired apps / icon)
+ fix blur strength
+ time/weather widget
+ battery widget
+ workspace switcher with thumbnails
  + [add delay to thumbnail capture](https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/linux-unix-sleep-bash-scripting/)
  + add gitignore for thumbnails
  + spawn switcher when tag switch
+ change volume / brightness to extend out from side similar to other widgets in theme
+ lock screen
+ fix & prune round-client, and client decoration
+ add animations
